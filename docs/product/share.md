# XBuilder Sharing Feature Plan

## Overview

XBuilder is an innovative platform for learning programming and creating games, dedicated to providing users with a complete creative ecosystem from learning programming skills to publishing game works.

However, the current sharing mechanism of the platform suffers from poor user experience and limited dissemination, which restricts the spread of high-quality content and the growth of the user base. To address these issues, we have developed a systematic plan to optimize the sharing feature:

1. Optimize the sharing process to improve user convenience and lower the sharing threshold;  
2. Beautify shared content and adapt to multiple platforms to enhance dissemination, increase content appeal and reach, and attract more new users to XBuilder.

## 1. Key Decisions

### 1.1 Supported Platforms

One-click sharing support for each platform:

| **Platform** | **Direct Share** | **Screenshot Share** | **Screen Recording Share** |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| WeChat       | Rich Link        |                      | Rich Link                  |
| QQ           | Rich Link        |                      | Rich Link                  |
| Douyin       | Poster           | Poster               | Video                      |
| Xiaohongshu  | Poster           | Poster               |                            |
| Bilibili     |                  |                      | Video                      |

**Main Sharing Methods:**

1. **Direct Share**: Share as a rich link to WeChat and QQ, or as a poster image to Douyin and Xiaohongshu;  
2. **Screenshot Share**: One-click share as an image to Douyin and Xiaohongshu;  
3. **Screen Recording Share**: Save the recording to the XBuilder platform and share the link as a rich link to WeChat and QQ, or as a video to Douyin and Bilibili.

**Basis:**

According to the "Blue Book of Youth: China Minors' Internet Usage Report (2024)" by the Institute of Journalism and Communication, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the top four platforms frequently used by minors are: Douyin (54.9%), WeChat (36.8%), Bilibili (29%), and Xiaohongshu (21.6%).

### 1.2 Target Users

- **Creators**: Minors around 10 years old learning programming  
- **Potential Creators**

### 1.3 Sharing Flow

- **Purpose**: To make sharing smoother for XBuilder users (including creators and potential creators) and make it easier for recipients to return to the platform.

### 1.4 Mobile Adaptation

- **Web Pages**
  - Pages that need mobile adaptation:
    - Homepage `index`
    - Project page `Project`
    - User page `Profile`

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Primary and Secondary Sharing

- **Primary Sharing**: Users actively use the "Share" feature provided by XBuilder to generate and publish shareable content (rich links, posters, or direct sharing to social platforms).  
- **Secondary Sharing**: Users forward or disseminate the shareable content generated by primary sharing without using the XBuilder "Share" feature again.

### 2.2 Poster

#### Definition

Users can view brief project information and display images through posters, and enter the game project by scanning the QR code.

Posters are generated as images, making it easy for users to complete primary sharing; others can forward the image for secondary sharing and scan the QR code to quickly access XBuilder.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of a poster includes:

- **Project**: Associated project (attributes like URL, Name, Owner, etc.);  
- **Present**: Display image (from 1. project thumbnail; 2. project screenshot).

### 2.3 Rich Link

#### Definition

A rich link is a link format designed for information dissemination on social platforms (especially QQ and WeChat). Compared to plain links, it can carry more project and platform information.

Rich links are generated for easy primary sharing; others can forward the link for secondary sharing and click to directly access XBuilder.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of a rich link includes:

- **Project**: Associated project (Name, Owner, etc.);  
- **Icon**: URL storing the XBuilder icon.

### 2.4 Screen Recording Logs

#### Definition

- **Screen Recording (action)**: The act of recording a user's on-screen operation on a public project at a certain moment.  
- **Screen Recording Log (result)**: A saved record on XBuilder generated from a screen recording action, containing the video file and its metadata. Each project can have zero or more screen recording logs. Access permissions for screen recording logs are independent of the project's public status and are public by default.

#### Sharing Forms and Targets

- **Video Sharing (external platforms)**: Export a video from a screen recording log and post it to platforms such as Douyin and Bilibili with one click. The shared item is the **video file** itself.  
- **Rich Link Sharing (internal)**: Generate a rich link pointing to the screen recording log (for WeChat, QQ, etc.). The shared item is the **link**. Clicking it opens the recording's detail page on XBuilder, where users can watch the recording and navigate to the associated project. Secondary sharing simply forwards the same link, always pointing to the same recording log.

#### Core Attributes (Screen Recording Log)

Basic information of a screen recording log includes:

- **Project**: Associated project information;  
- **Video**: Video information of the recording log (storage URL, duration, file size, cover image, etc.);  
- **Owner**: Owner of the recording log;  
- **LikeCount**: Number of likes (within the platform);  
- **ViewCount**: Number of views (within the platform);  
- **Description**: Description of the recording log;  
- **Title**: Title of the recording log.

### 2.5 Mobile Adaptation

#### Definition

Mobile Adaptation is associated with each release and is used to configure a key layout suitable for mobile device operation, allowing mobile users to normally experience and operate the game project.

Game creators can independently set the Mobile Adaptation for each release.

> Existing projects on the platform are not automatically adapted; creators must configure them manually on the adaptation page.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of Mobile Adaptation includes:

- **Release**: Associated project release version information;  
- **AdaptationType**: Adaptation type (1. Not adapted for mobile; 2. No keys needed; 3. Custom keys);  
- **KeyMapping** (optional, when AdaptationType = 3): Key mapping configuration (including key types and layout positions).
