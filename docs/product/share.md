# XBuilder Sharing Feature Proposal

## Overview

XBuilder is an innovative platform for learning programming and creating games, dedicated to providing users with a complete creative ecosystem from learning programming skills to publishing game works.

However, the current sharing mechanism of the platform suffers from poor user experience and limited dissemination, which restricts the spread of high-quality content and the growth of the user base. To address these issues, we have developed a systematic plan to optimize the sharing feature:

1. Optimize the sharing process to improve user convenience and lower the sharing threshold;
2. Beautify shared content and adapt to multiple platforms to enhance dissemination, increase content appeal and reach, and attract more new users to XBuilder.

## 1. Key Decisions

### 1.1 Supported Platforms

One-click sharing support for each platform:

| **Platform** | **Direct Share** | **Screenshot Share** | **Screen Recording Share** |
|:------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| WeChat       | Rich Link        |                      | Rich Link                  |
| QQ           | Rich Link        |                      | Rich Link                  |
| Douyin       | Poster           | Poster               | Video                      |
| Xiaohongshu  | Poster           | Poster               |                            |
| Bilibili     |                  |                      | Video                      |

**Main Sharing Methods:**

1. **Direct Share**: Share as a rich link to WeChat and QQ, or as a poster image to Douyin and Xiaohongshu;
2. **Screenshot Share**: One-click share as an image to Douyin and Xiaohongshu;
3. **Screen Recording Share**: Save the recording to the XBuilder platform and share the link as a rich link to WeChat and QQ, or as a video to Douyin and Bilibili.

**Basis:**

According to the "Blue Book of Youth: China Minors' Internet Usage Report (2024)" by the Institute of Journalism and Communication, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the top four platforms frequently used by minors are: Douyin (54.9%), WeChat (36.8%), Bilibili (29%), and Xiaohongshu (21.6%).

### 1.2 Target Users

- **Creators**: Minors around 10 years old learning programming
- **Potential Creators**

### 1.3 Sharing Flow

- **Purpose**: To make sharing smoother for XBuilder users (including creators and potential creators) and make it easier for recipients to return to the platform.

### 1.4 Mobile Adaptation

- **Web Pages**
  - Pages that need mobile adaptation:
    - Homepage `index`
    - Project page `Project`
    - User page `Profile`
- **Key Mapping**
  - The mobile key mapping of a game is configured by its creator, with options: 1. Not adapted for mobile, only playable on PC; 2. No keys needed, just watch or use touch; 3. Custom keys: creators select required keys and layout
  - Key mapping is bound to the project's release: one strategy is to store a key config for each release; another is to let creators choose whether to reuse the previous config when updatingâ€”if "yes", the platform doesn't save a new config and will backtrack to the last valid one; if "no", jump to the config page and save the new config
  - Existing projects are not automatically adapted; creators need to click the config button on the project page

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1 Primary and Secondary Sharing

- **Primary Sharing**: Users actively use the "Share" feature provided by XBuilder to generate and publish shareable content (rich links, posters, or direct sharing to social platforms).
- **Secondary Sharing**: Users forward or disseminate the shareable content generated by primary sharing without using the XBuilder "Share" feature again.

### 2.2 Poster

#### Definition

Users can view brief project information and display images through posters, and enter the game project by scanning the QR code.

Posters are generated as images, making it easy for users to complete primary sharing; others can forward the image for secondary sharing and scan the QR code to quickly access XBuilder.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of a poster includes:

- **Project**: Associated project (attributes like URL, Name, Owner, etc.);
- **Present**: Display image (from 1. project thumbnail; 2. project screenshot).

### 2.3 Rich Link

#### Definition

A rich link is a link format designed for information dissemination on social platforms (especially QQ and WeChat). Compared to plain links, it can carry more project and platform information.

Rich links are generated for easy primary sharing; others can forward the link for secondary sharing and click to directly access XBuilder.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of a rich link includes:

- **Project**: Associated project (Name, Owner, etc.);
- **Icon**: URL storing the XBuilder icon.

### 2.4 Screen Recording

#### Definition

Screen recording refers to the system recording the user's screen operation process on a public project at a certain moment. Each Project can be recorded multiple times, i.e., can have zero or more recordings. Recordings can be shared as videos or rich links.

Users can submit videos to video platforms with one click, or share as a rich link. Others can forward the video or link for secondary sharing, and click the link to return to XBuilder or directly watch the recording.

#### Access Permissions

Screen recording access is independent of the Project's public status and is public by default.

#### Core Attributes

Basic information of a screen recording includes:

- **Project**: Associated project information;
- **Video**: Recording video information (storage URL, duration, file size, etc.);
- **Owner**: Recording owner;
- **LikeCount**: Number of likes for the recording;
- **ViewCount**: Number of views for the recording;
- **Description**: Description of the recording;
- **Title**: Title of the recording.
