## Final Choice: Monaco Editor

Monaco Editor stands out due to its rich feature set, excellent performance, and seamless integration with Visual Studio Code. It provides a powerful and extensible environment for code editing, making it suitable for various development scenarios. The backing of Microsoft adds credibility and ensures ongoing support and updates. For these reasons, Monaco Editor is the recommended choice, especially when working on projects that demand a feature-rich, high-performance code editing experience.

## Demo

The following is a simple demo using Monaco Editor in the Vue 3 framework.

```vue
<template>
  <!-- The container for the Monaco Editor with a reference "code_editor" -->
  <div ref="code_editor" id="code-editor"></div>
</template>

<script setup>
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor'
import { onBeforeUnmount, onMounted, ref } from 'vue';

// Define the language for the editor (spx for SPX code in this case)
const LANGUAGE = 'spx';
// Reference to the code editor container
const code_editor = ref(null);

// Hook called after the component is mounted
onMounted(() => {
  // Create a new Monaco Editor instance in the specified container with the specified language
  monaco.editor.create(code_editor.value, {
    language: LANGUAGE,
  });
});
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Scoped style to set the height of the code editor to 100% of the viewport height */
#code-editor {
  height: 100vh;
}
</style>
```
