A towering, broad-shouldered figure composed of dark, charcoal-gray pixel clusters. Glowing cracks of orange and yellow embers cover its muscular torso and limbs. Two massive, horn-like obsidian protrusions curve from its head. Its wings are tattered, bat-like shapes of deep crimson and black, edged with a fiery glow. It clutches a fiery whip, a serpentine line of bright red and yellow pixels that smolders at its tip. The face is a shadowy recess with two piercing white-hot points for eyes.
