Perfect right side view of the Balrog of Moria in a powerful, striding pose. Its muscular torso and limbs, made of charcoal-gray pixel clusters with glowing ember cracks, are captured mid-walk. One massive leg is forward, the other back, with its tattered, fiery-edged wings partially unfurled. Its head, with obsidian horns, is turned slightly forward, shadowy face illuminated by two piercing white-hot eyes. It clutches a long, serpentine fiery whip that arcs behind it, smoldering at the tip. Empty white background.
