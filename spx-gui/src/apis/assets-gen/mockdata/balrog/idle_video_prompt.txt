A towering pixel-art Balrog stands centered in an empty white void. Its massive, charcoal-gray chest slowly rises and falls with deep, rhythmic breathing. Glowing embers within its form pulse with a soft, fiery light. The creature's horned head tilts slightly, its piercing white eyes slowly scanning the emptiness. Its tattered, bat-like wings gently rustle and shift, as if stirred by an unseen heat haze. In one hand, the Balrog loosely holds its whip; the fiery tip of the whip slowly undulates and curls, coiling and uncoiling in a lazy, hypnotic rhythm. The entire sequence is a seamless, looping idle animation.
