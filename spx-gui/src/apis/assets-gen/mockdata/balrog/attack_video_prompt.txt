A towering, pixel-art Balrog of Moria stands tall in a white void. It roars, a wave of fiery energy pulsing from its core, causing the embers on its body to flare brightly. It leans forward aggressively, then charges across the empty space with powerful, ground-shaking strides, its tattered wings stretching wide. It violently cracks its long, fiery whip, sending a ripple of orange and yellow pixels snapping through the air. The creature continues its relentless charge towards the viewer, its piercing white eyes fixed ahead, before it unleashes a final, immense roar, engulfing the screen in fire and smoke.
