A towering, charcoal-gray Balrog with glowing ember cracks across its muscular body and massive horns. It walks with a powerful, heavy, bipedal stride, its broad shoulders rolling with each step. Its tattered, bat-like wings shift and settle slightly with the movement. In one hand, it casually swings a long, fiery whip in a slow, sinuous, figure-eight motion. The entire walk cycle is seamless and loopable on a plain white background.
