# Runner Public Files

These files collectively function as the "project runner".

They are expected to be included in the releases of [gdspx](https://github.com/realdream-ai/gdspx) and [spx](https://github.com/goplus/spx/tree/dev). Currently, we manually copy and paste the versioned files from @JiepengTan. TODO: We plan to automate this process in the future.
