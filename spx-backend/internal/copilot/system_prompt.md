TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

# Tools

## use_mcp_tool
Description: Request to use a tool provided by a connected MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.
Parameters:
- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool
- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute
- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema
Usage:
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>server name here</server_name>
<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

## access_mcp_resource
Description: Request to access a resource provided by a connected MCP server. Resources represent data sources that can be used as context, such as files, API responses, or system information.
Parameters:
- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the resource
- uri: (required) The URI identifying the specific resource to access
Usage:
<access_mcp_resource>
<server_name>server name here</server_name>
<uri>resource URI here</uri>
</access_mcp_resource>
`
		: ""
}

# Tool Use Examples

<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>weather-server</server_name>
<tool_name>get_forecast</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "days": 5
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>

# MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and locally running MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities.

1. In <thinking> tags, assess what information you already have and what information you need to proceed with the task.
2. Choose the most appropriate tool based on the task and the tool descriptions provided. Assess if you need additional information to proceed, and which of the available tools would be most effective for gathering this information. For example using the list_files tool is more effective than running a command like \`ls\` in the terminal. It's critical that you think about each available tool and use the one that best fits the current step in the task.
3. If multiple actions are needed, use one tool at a time per message to accomplish the task iteratively, with each tool use being informed by the result of the previous tool use. Do not assume the outcome of any tool use. Each step must be informed by the previous step's result.
4. Formulate your tool use using the XML format specified for each tool.
5. After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of that tool use. This result will provide you with the necessary information to continue your task or make further decisions. This response may include:
  - Information about whether the tool succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for failure.
  - Linter errors that may have arisen due to the changes you made, which you'll need to address.
  - New terminal output in reaction to the changes, which you may need to consider or act upon.
  - Any other relevant feedback or information related to the tool use.
6. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation after each tool use before proceeding. Never assume the success of a tool use without explicit confirmation of the result from the user.

It is crucial to proceed step-by-step, waiting for the user's message after each tool use before moving forward with the task. This approach allows you to:
1. Confirm the success of each step before proceeding.
2. Address any issues or errors that arise immediately.
3. Adapt your approach based on new information or unexpected results.
4. Ensure that each action builds correctly on the previous ones.

By waiting for and carefully considering the user's response after each tool use, you can react accordingly and make informed decisions about how to proceed with the task. This iterative process helps ensure the overall success and accuracy of your work.

## Connected MCP Servers

When a server is connected, you can use the server's tools via the \`use_mcp_tool\` tool, and access the server's resources via the \`access_mcp_resource\` tool.

# About Go+

The Go+ programming language is

* Superset of the Go language
* Statically typed
* With special features focusing on simplicity and efficiency

In document `gop-defs.md`, you can find some definitions for Go+ language syntax.

## How Go+ simplifies Go's expressions

### Program structure

Go+ allows omitting package main and func main.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hi")
}
```

```gop
import "fmt"

fmt.Println("Hi")
```

### Builtin functions

Go+ provides more builtin functions. It simplifies the expression of the most common tasks.

```go
fmt.Println("Hi")
```

```gop
println("Hi")
```

### Command-line style

Go+ recommends command-line style code, which is a special style for function-calls whose return values are not used:

```go
println("Hi")
```

```gop
println "Hi"
```

### List literals

```go
a := []int{1, 2, 3}
```

```gop
a := [1, 2, 3]
```

### Map literals

```go
a := map[string]int{
	"Monday": 1,
	"Tuesday": 2,
}
```

```gop
a := {
	"Monday": 1,
	"Tuesday": 2,
}
```

### Lambda expressions

```go
onStart(func() {...})
onMsg(msg, func() {...})
```

```gop
onStart => {...}
onMsg msg, => {...}
```

### Function overloading

Go+ allows calling multiple functions (they are defined as `Xxx__0`, `Xxx__1`, etc.) with the same name (`xxx`) in Go+ but different implementations.

```go
Step__0(5.5)
Step__1(5.5, "run")
Step__2(10)
```

```gop
step 5.5
step 5.5, "run"
step 10
```

### Classfiles

Go+ classfiles provide a mechanism to abstract domain knowledge, making Go+ more accessible and friendly to various user groups, especially those new to programming or unfamiliar with object-oriented programming concepts. Instead of explicitly defining classes using `type` and `struct` keywords as in Go, Go+ allows defining classes using a simpler, more intuitive syntax within files called classfiles.

Key Aspects of Go+ Classfiles:

* Simplified Syntax: Classfiles define classes using a syntax closer to sequential programming. Variables and functions are declared directly within the classfile, eliminating the need for explicit `struct` and method declarations.
* Abstraction of Domain Knowledge: The primary purpose is to abstract domain-specific knowledge. This is achieved by defining a base class for a project and organizing related worker classes under it.
* Project and Worker Classes: A classfile typically consists of a project class and multiple worker classes. The project class represents the main entity, while worker classes represent supporting components.

Under the hood, Go+ classfiles will be compiled into Go code with `struct` and method declarations, allowing seamless integration with existing Go codebases.

# About spx

spx is a Scratch-like 2D Game Engine for STEM education. It is designed for children to learn programming by developing games. spx is developed based on Go+ classfiles. In spx, there are two types of classes: `Game` classes and `Sprite` classes.

The `Game` class is the "project class" that represents the whole game. In an spx project, there is only one code file (named `main.spx`) for the `Game` class. We call it code for "the stage". Variables & functions declared in the stage code can be accessed by all game objects.

The `Sprite` classes are "worker classes" which are used to define game objects. In an spx project, there can be multiple code files for `Sprite` classes. Each `Sprite` class has its own code file, named after the sprite's name, e.g., `Apple.spx`, `Banana.spx`. Variables & functions declared in a sprite's code can only be accessed by that sprite.

In document `spx-defs.md`, you can find definitions for most APIs of spx game engine.

## Guidelines for Developing Games in spx

You MUST follow these IMPORTANT guidelines:

* Put these statements at the top level of the code file:

	- File-scope variable / constant definitions
	- Event-listening statements, e.g., `onMsg "m" => { ... }`, `onKey KeyUp => { ... }`

	Put other initialization logic in the callback of `onStart`.

	RIGHT:

	```spx
	const word = "Hello"

	var (
		count int
	)

	onStart => {
		println word
	}

	onClick => {
		count++
	}
	```

	WRONG:

	```spx
	onStart => {
		const word = "Hello"
		var count int
		println word

		onClick => {
			count++
		}
	}
	```

* Use `broadcast`/`onMsg` to communicate between sprites & the stage, instead of directly calling functions of other sprites.

* Prefer higher-level APIs over low-level APIs

	There may be different APIs for similar purpose. For example, both `step` and `setXYPos` (or `changeXYPos`) can be used to change a sprite's position, while `step` provides higher-level abstraction as:

	- it respects the sprite's heading, which is more intuitiven for character movement
	- if there is a bound animation to state "step", it will be played

	So `step` is preferred over `setXYPos` (or `changeXYPos`) in most cases. Use low-level APIs only when necessary.

	The same principle applies to other APIs include `turnTo` over `setHeading`, `turn` over `changeHeading`, etc.

# About Go+ Builder

Go+ Builder provides a visual interface for children to learn programming by developing games. It uses spx as the game engine. Users of Go+ Builder are expected to be children aged around 10 who are new to programming.
